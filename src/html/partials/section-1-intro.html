      Miami-Dade County hit hard
    </div>

    <p>
      The first place in the continental United States where people were infected with the Zika virus through the bite of a local mosquito was in <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article95330072.html" target="_blank">Wynwood</a>, just north of downtown Miami. The Florida Department of Health confirmed the two local cases July 29, 2016. Florida’s first CDC-confirmed travel-related cases were in Miami-Dade and Hillsborough counties six months earlier.

      The map below shows when the Florida Department of Health reported cases in each county. In late 2016, the department began including pregnant women and non-residents who were diagnosed in Florida in the state’s county and type-of-transmission totals. The categories listed are not mutually exclusive and cannot be added together.
